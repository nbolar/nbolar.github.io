## About Weather Status
Weather Status is a simple and beautiful desktop app for macOS. It shows the current weather situation in the status bar and provides a more detailed version of the weather conditions of your current location once clicked.

Weather Status also provides a 7-day weather forecast which can be viewed by scrolling left of the tiles. Upon hovering the cursor over the the image of the forecast, it shows a popup with more information about the weather on that day.

It is powered by the DarkSky weather API for weather information as well as Mapbox API for location lookup.

You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbolar/Weather-Status) or if you'd like to support my work you can grab it on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-status/id1453284596?ls=1&mt=12).
