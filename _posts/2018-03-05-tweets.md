# Introduction
1. Data Preprocessing (NLP)
    + **URL removal**: For the purpose of this exercise all URLs were removed from the tweets because no real sentiment value can be associated with links and do not provide any worthy data worth training and classifying.
    + **Elongated words**: Words that contained three or more of the same letters together were stripped to now include only two. By doing so it the vocabulary generated by the feature extracted would be more accurate and contain far less redundant features.
    + **Positive emoticon faces**: All the positive emoticon faces were replaced by the text “happy”. By doing this, the sentiment classifier would be better able to train itself and correctly classify tweets as positive.
    + **Negative emoticon faces**: All the negative emoticon faces were replaced by the text “sad”. By doing this, the sentiment classifier would be better able to train itself and correctly classify tweets as negative.
