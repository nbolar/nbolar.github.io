## Introduction

Two villages 2 kilometres apart communicate through a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN). Village 1, which has the transceiver Node 0, sends packets to transceiver Node 1. Node 1 is in a bus that travels to the vicinity of Village 2, and back to Village 1 at a constant speed of 25 m/s. Node 1 transfers the packets to transceiver Node 2. The initial position of all nodes is depicted in the figure below.
The main task is to complete the simulation of this DTN for the transmission of 50 packets from Village 1 to Village 2 using NS-3.
