## About Weather Status
Weather Status is a simple and beautiful desktop app for macOS.

Weather Status also provides a 7-day weather forecast which can be viewed by scrolling left of the tiles. Upon hovering the cursor over the the image of the forecast, it shows a popup with more information about the weather on that day.

You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbolar/Weather-Status) or if you'd like to support my work you can grab it on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-status/id1453284596?ls=1&mt=12).
