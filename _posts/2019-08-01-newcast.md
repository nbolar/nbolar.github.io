## About Newcast
I'm a podcast fan and listen to quite a few of them on my iPhone. A quick peek into the iOS App Store and you'll find dozens of podcast players. But when I did the same on the Mac App Store, I found very few podcast players. So I decided to develop a rather clean and minimal one. It isn't quite done yet, but is on track to becoming better than what I envisioned. The final version of the app will also most likely be the MVP. Over time I hope to implement more advanced features but at the moment I'm focusing on making a good podcast playback app.
