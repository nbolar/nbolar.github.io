## What is Rates?
Rates is a simple macOS app that lives in your menu bar that allows you to quickly convert between currencies of your choice as well as monitor the exchange rates. It uses the fixer.io API to receive the exchange rates of 170 currencies, including Bitcoin, Gold and Silver rates.

The app allows you to choose any of the 170 currencies as your base currency to view the exchange rates. By default the base currency is set to USD. The rates are updated hourly.

You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbolar/Rates).
